## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. 
The questions asked for the first key were a bit confusing; getting files from a remote repo and putting it into the local repo is called pulling, but the answer was committing. Was the question asking what is the process of adding files to the remote repo stream, as in the stream that will later be pushed to the remote repo?
